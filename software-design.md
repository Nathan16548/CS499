Software Design and Engineering Enhancement 
Contact Service (CS 320)

Artifact Overview
The artifact being presented is the original Contact Service application from CS 320 Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance. The Contact Service application is an object-oriented design for contact records which utilizes a dedicated service layer for managing those records. The ContactService class implements the Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations with validation to enforce data integrity.

Why I Selected This Artifact
This artifact represents professional software design principles that can be applied to developing in industry. The Contact class provides a cohesive and readable data model for contacts; the ContactService class encapsulates business rules and operations in a manner that supports maintainability and readability. The separation of concerns demonstrated here will support readability, testing and the potential scalability of the Contact Service application.

Additionally, the artifact demonstrates my ability to apply best practices for validation, error handling and defensive programming. Industry software development has an expectation for reliability and data correctness and these practices provide a means to enforce such expectations.

Enhancement Description
In the area of software design and engineering, I enhanced the organization and maintainability of the artifact. The design separates concern with the Contact model encapsulating the data representation and the ContactService layer encapsulating the operational logic for the contact record. This separation of concern supports clean interfaces and consistent enforcement of rules while allowing for the ease of adding new functionality in the future.

Course Outcomes Demonstrated
This artifact addresses multiple course outcomes in CS 499, particularly:

• Evaluate and design computing solutions using computer science practices and standards
• Demonstrate the utilization of proven techniques and tools to develop solutions that meet value-based criteria
• Develop clear professional communication through the organized presentation of your code and documentation

Reflection
Publishing this artifact has helped me realize how important it is to have structured and readable presentations of software for audiences. By organizing the project into a clear model and service layer, you make your code easier to understand, easier to test, and easier to expand upon. One of the most difficult aspects of developing this application was making sure all of the requirements were met across each operation without having to duplicate the same logic. Utilizing unit tests provided a way to verify proper function while maintaining a clean and maintainable design.
