# CS499
Computer Science Capstone 2026

Welcome to my Computer Science Capstone E-portfolio! 
The E-portfolio provides access to the most important works of mine that showcase both growth and competence in some of the major areas of computer science (including software design and engineering, algorithms/data structures, and databases). 
Each of these areas is broken down into a single, refined artifact and a written description of the enhancements I made, the skills I used, and how each relates to one or more of our program outcomes.

Portfolio Areas
Software Design & Engineering 
I have included examples of my work on software architecture, maintainability, validation/testing through a service-based application I built in CS 320.

Algorithms & Data Structures
In this area, you will see an improved version of an artifact I developed to show evidence of "algorithmic thinking" and the proper use of "data structures".

Databases
This area will provide evidence of the structure of data, and concepts relating to databases.

About My E-portfolio
I created this E-portfolio as a result of completing the CS 499 Computer Science Capstone course, and it is intended to prove I am prepared for positions in software development and other related areas.
