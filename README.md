# CS499

Computer Science Capstone 2026

Welcome to my Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio. This portfolio showcases my growth and competency across key areas of computer science, including software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Each section contains a refined artifact and an accompanying narrative that explains the enhancements made, the skills demonstrated, and how the work aligns with the Computer Science program outcomes.

## Informal Code Review

The following video provides an informal code review of the selected artifact prior to enhancement. In the video, I walk through the existing functionality, identify areas for improvement, and explain the planned enhancements aligned with the CS 499 course outcomes.
