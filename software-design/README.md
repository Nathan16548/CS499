Software Design and Engineering Artifact (Contact Service)
Overview 
The Contact Service is an example of a Contact Management Application that was developed in this class for the CS 320 Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance class. This project demonstrates how to implement a service-based design for managing contact information records as part of a larger mobile application. The Contact Service supports create, update, retrieve, delete operations on contact records and also validates all user input.

Enhancement Focus 
I chose to include this artifact in my Software Design and Engineering section of my CS 499 ePortfolio because I wanted to show evidence of how to design clean software architectures, separate concerns and design maintainable applications. The Contact class handles the validated data and the ContactService class acts as a central management layer to enforce business logic and control access to the contact records.

Skills Demonstrated 
Designing with object-oriented design principles
Designing a service-layer architecture
Implementing input validation and error handling
Using Test-Driven Development (TDD) with JUnit
Structuring readable and maintainable code

Course Alignment 
This artifact aligns with the course outcomes of CS 499 including designing and evaluating computing solutions, implementing industry-standard software engineering practices, and developing professional-quality software artifacts.
