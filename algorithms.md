Algorithms and Data Structures Enhancement

Artifact Overview 
The artifact in question was created during my coursework prior to CS 499. I completed additional development on the project as part of Milestone II of the capstone. The focus of the project is to utilize algorithmic thought and data structure techniques to provide an efficient solution to a defined problem. The implementation demonstrates structured logic, correct data management, and clear control flow.

Why This Artifact Was Added To My ePortfolio 
I added this artifact to demonstrate my ability to develop and evaluate solutions based upon algorithmic thought rather than relying entirely upon the capabilities of programming languages. The code illustrates how data structures and algorithms interact and assist one another to provide predictable and efficient solutions. The artifact also illustrates my growth in understanding how design decisions affect performance, readability, and maintainability of code.

Summary Of Enhancements 
When creating the enhancements for the algorithms and data structures category, I concentrated on enhancing the clarity, efficiency, and organization of the solution. The emphasis of the enhancements was to select proper data structures, refine the logic of algorithms, and reduce extraneous complexity. These enhancements were able to improve the performance and readability of the code without affecting its correctness.

Reflection On What I Have Learned 
Completing the enhancements on this artifact further solidified the necessity of developing algorithms before they are implemented into code. One of the biggest challenges I faced was finding the right balance between efficiency and readability; especially when implementing logic to address edge cases. This experience has improved my ability to assess problems, identify suitable data structures, and articulate why specific design decisions were made. The instructor's feedback supported the idea that the enhancements I made aligned well with standard practices of software engineering and algorithmics.

Outcomes Demonstrated By Coursework 
This artifact demonstrated my growth towards the course outcomes of CS 499 pertaining to designing and evaluating computing solutions, applying computer science standards, and documenting technical decisions to facilitate communication with others.
