Professional Self-Assessment
The Computer Science program, as well as the CS 499 capstone course, has provided me with a solid foundation in developing software, problem-solving, and communicating professionally. Additionally, through enhancing artifacts in the CS 499 program, I was able to apply theory to practice, while continuing to develop my abilities in evaluating and presenting computing-based solutions. Further, by creating my e-portfolio, I have been able to reflect upon my growth as a computer science professional, and identify how I can position myself within the profession.
I believe that my greatest area of growth has been in software design and engineering. For example, while completing projects (e.g., the CS 320 Contact Service), I was able to gain experience in designing maintainable, service-based applications with a clear separation of concerns. In addition, I concentrated on writing readable, testable code, and consistently enforced validation and business rules. These experiences have furthered my understanding of how thoughtful design decisions positively affect scalability, reliability, and long-term maintainability of an application.
Additionally, I have expanded my knowledge of algorithms and data structures, which have enhanced my ability to decompose complex problems into smaller components and select effective methods to solve them based on efficiency and clarity. I have refined my ability to logically analyze algorithms and make informed decisions about trade-offs between performance and readability. I have found that there is a direct relationship between design decisions and overall solution quality. Therefore, I now believe it is essential to plan before implementing a solution and compare it to the specific requirements.
As for my database experiences, I have improved my understanding of structuring data and maintaining data integrity. Although, at times, I have worked with in-memory storage, I have always utilized database principles (i.e., validation, controlled access, consistent data management). I believe that these experiences have demonstrated that software design and data persistence are intertwined and scalable.
Another area where I have grown significantly is in collaboration and communication. Throughout the peer review processes, instructor feedback, and documentation, I have continued to develop my ability to explain technical decisions to various audiences. The code review process in the CS 499 class has assisted me in clearly articulating the design intent behind my coding decisions, and in reflecting upon areas for improvement. As a result of these experiences, I now believe that collaboration is critical in professional software environments.
Lastly, security awareness has been a recurring theme throughout my course work. I have developed a habit of validating input, defensive error handling, and designing for security by considering potential vulnerabilities introduced through design decisions. Although I continue to evolve in terms of advanced security-focused design, I believe that I have developed a fundamental security mindset that I will carry forward in all of my future projects.
Overall, I believe that my artifacts provide a comprehensive view of my capabilities in terms of software engineering, algorithms, and data management. In addition, the professional self-assessment serves as a gateway to the technical artifacts that follow, illustrating how each artifact collectively demonstrates my capabilities, growth, and preparedness for entry into a professional environment within the computer science field.
