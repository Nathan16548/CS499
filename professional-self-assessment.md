I had a great deal of time to develop my own personal views about professional responsibility in my courses and by using the CS 499 capstone course to complete the remaining 15 hours of my degree. The e-portfolio I created during the last six weeks of the program provided me with the opportunity to create a reflection of my growth from a student in the Computer Science program to a practicing professional in the field of Computer Science.

While creating my portfolio I reflected on the many ways in which I used what I learned in my Computer Science courses to develop the technical skills necessary to be successful in my career. I had the opportunity to use what I learned in class to develop my technical skills as well as my ability to communicate effectively with a variety of audiences.

As I progressed through the curriculum, I found that my technical abilities improved dramatically. One of the biggest areas of growth for me was in the area of software design and engineering. In my courses, I had the opportunity to design a number of different types of software applications including service-based applications that were designed with maintainability in mind. These applications were designed with a clear separation of concerns so that each component could be easily modified or replaced without affecting other parts of the system. When designing these applications, I made sure that I wrote readable and testable code and that I enforced validation and business rules at all times. I believe that these experiences gave me a much greater appreciation for the importance of making thoughtful design decisions early in the development process. If a developer does not think about the long-term implications of their design decisions, they may find themselves having to rewrite large amounts of code later in the project in order to fix some type of scalability issue. My experience in developing applications with structured architectures and discipline design practices has shown me that it is possible to write scalable, reliable, and maintainable software.

In addition to improving my technical skills, I also improved my knowledge of algorithms and data structures. As I progressed through the curriculum, I began to see that breaking down complex problems into smaller pieces (or decomposing them) was often the first step in finding a solution. Once broken down, I would then focus on selecting a good algorithm to solve the problem. As I worked with algorithms, I began to see the need to consider issues related to efficiency and clarity. In general, there is always a trade off between the two; if an algorithm is efficient but difficult to understand, it may be better to choose a less efficient one that is easier to understand. Conversely, if an algorithm is easy to understand but inefficient, you may want to look for a more efficient alternative. Through this process, I came to appreciate the value of planning ahead and evaluating your solutions against specific requirements. In many cases, choosing a particular algorithm for a problem can greatly affect the overall quality of the solution to that problem.

Working with databases and managing data also allowed me to expand my understanding of structured data and data integrity. I found that even when I was working with in-memory storage, I continued to apply many of the same principles as I would with a traditional relational database. For example, I always validated data, ensured controlled access, and handled data in a way that was consistent regardless of where it was being stored. Ultimately, these experiences showed me that designing software and persisting data are very intertwined processes. By enforcing data integrity at the application layer, developers can ensure that their systems are reliable and set up for success should they ever decide to store their data in a persistent database.

Another important aspect of my development throughout the program has been my ability to collaborate and communicate effectively. Throughout the program, I have been required to participate in peer reviews, receive instructor feedback, and document my technical contributions in written documents. Additionally, in the CS 499 capstone course, I participated in informal code reviews that allowed me to articulate my design decisions to my peers, defend enhancement choices, and identify areas where I needed to improve. These experiences solidified my belief that collaboration and communication are essential in professional software development environments.

Finally, a major theme of my coursework has been the idea of a "security mindset." I have developed a habit of validating user input, handling errors defensively, and considering potential vulnerabilities that I introduce into my designs. Although I still have much to learn about security-focused design, the habits I have formed have instilled in me a fundamental security mindset that prioritizes protecting data, maintaining system reliability, and ensuring long-term maintainability. This mindset will continue to inform my approach to software development moving forward.

Overall, the artifacts presented in my e-portfolio demonstrate my skills in software engineering, algorithms, and data management. The professional self-assessment serves as an introductory section to the technical artifacts that follow, providing evidence of how each artifact contributes to demonstrating my capabilities, growth, and preparedness for entering a professional setting in the computer science field.
